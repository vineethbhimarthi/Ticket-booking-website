      <p id="cd"><span> Palace on Wheels</span> is a luxury tourist train. It was launched by the Indian Railways in association with Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation to promote tourism in Rajasthan.
         It is now known as Heritage Palace on Wheels. The train service was refurbished and relaunched in August 2009 with a new decor, itinerary and cuisine.
         The Palace on Wheels started on 26 January 1982. The concept of the Palace on Wheels was derived from the royal background of the coaches, which were originally meant to be the personal railway coaches of the erstwhile rulers of the princely states of Rajputana, Baroda, the Nizam of Hyderabad and mainly the Viceroy of British India.
